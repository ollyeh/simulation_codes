# Simulation codes
Simulation codes is a collection of very simple python programs which model problems from statistical physics. The ambition of this collection is to break down the microscopic laws that govern phenomena like pressure or diffusion. Most importantly, the codes should help in understanding how these microscopic laws are implemented, making heavy use of Jupyter notebooks and excessively commented code.
